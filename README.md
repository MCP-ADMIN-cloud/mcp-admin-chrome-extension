Welcome to the MCP Admin Chrome Extension! This powerful tool allows you to connect directly to your managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and interact with them using advanced LLMs (Gemini or OpenAI) right from your browser's side panel.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

Since this is a custom-packed Chrome Extension, you'll need to install it manually using Chrome's Developer Mode.

1. **Download the Package:**
   Download the `final_extension.zip` file located in the root folder of this project to your local computer.
2. **Extract the Files:**
   Unzip `final_extension.zip` into a folder on your computer.
3. **Open Chrome Extensions:**
   In your Google Chrome browser, type `chrome://extensions/` into the URL bar and hit Enter.
4. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   Toggle the **Developer mode** switch in the top right corner of the Extensions page so that it is turned **ON**.
5. **Load the Extension:**
   Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears in the top left corner.
   Select the unzipped `final_extension` folder from step 2.

The **MCP Admin Plugin** should now appear in your list of extensions! You can pin it to your toolbar by clicking the puzzle piece icon next to your profile avatar and clicking the pin icon.

## 💬 How to Use

Once configured, the main chat interface will unlock.

* **Select an MCP Server:** At the top of the chat window, use the dropdown menu to select which of your deployed MCP servers you want to interact with. (Use the refresh icon to pull the latest list from your Admin API).
* **Transport:** Ensure the transport method (e.g., `sse`) is correctly selected for your server.
* **Chatting:** Type a message into the chat box. The LLM will automatically evaluate your request, review the MCP tools available on the selected server, and execute them natively in the background to assist you!
* **Manage Sessions:** Use the sidebar to create new chat threads, switch between historical conversations, or export a chat log to Markdown.
